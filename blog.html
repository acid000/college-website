                <p>Social Media is powerful and it has been integrated into all aspects of our lives. This new
                    technology has been a mental struggle for many. Being able to access anyone’s personal information
                    at the touch of your fingertips is very unsettling. Why us? Why our generation? I think the answer
                    comes into play with the general idea of my last blog Mental Health Tips: How to Look at the Glass
                    Half Full, optimistic thinking. If you look at the glass half full when it comes to scrolling
                    through social media you are already at a great start. It can be extremely intimidating to see old
                    peers or distant family “living their best life” online, but in reality that’s never the case.
                    Everyone has their own struggles and posting online is sometimes a mechanism to let everyone else
                    know that “you’re doing great”, but in reality, you’re definitely facing some sort of issue.
                    Honestly, it’s all psychology. If you go to Florida, your social media will see you vibing out on a
                    beach in your cutest bikini but honestly, that’s not really why you are there. In reality, you are
                    visiting your sick grandmother, but you didn’t share that on social media and no one would think
                    twice. The key to looking as happy as you do online is to analyze reality and not compare! I can’t
                    wait to share all the researched tips and tricks I have learned in order to make your real life as
                    happy as your social media life.</p><br>
